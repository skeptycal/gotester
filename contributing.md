### All we're looking for from you is kind and creative communication, suggestions, or fixes.

We're all here to learn, so let people know that they can do it! Let people know that they are welcome to be here too.

> This is an open source project and I love to receive contributions from the community â€” you! There are many ways to contribute, so keep an open mind and think outside the box.
>
> I'm only looking for positive and constructive ideas. If you have something negative to communicate, please leave that pretty much anywhere else. Images, messages, and ideas that communicate negativity will not be approved.

# Ground Rules

Be positive, be welcoming.

> Responsibilities
>
> - Ensure cross-platform compatibility for every change that's accepted. Windows, Mac, Debian & Ubuntu Linux.
> - Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
> - Don't add any classes to the codebase unless absolutely needed. Err on the side of using functions.
> - Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature per version.
> - Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds. See the [Python Community Code of Conduct for a better description of what I mean](https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/).

# Help!

Not sure how you got here or how to get started?

> Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn more from this _free_ series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first

# How to report a bug

If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Notify me personally, please.

> If you decide to file an issue, make sure to use the templates for [Bug Reports][br] or [Feature Requests][fr] as a guideline.

# Just so you know

I look at Pull Requests on a regular basis. I'm doing this on my own, so it might take a little time before I get to every pull request, but I promise I will!

> If feedback has been given, I expect responses within one month. After one month, I may close the pull request if it isn't showing any activity. Chances are, though, if you are submitting a simple note or image, your change will be merged without feedback. I'm just putting this here for the rare instance that I might need a little more information from you.

# Thank You!

> It is your participation that makes the community great.
